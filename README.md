Scetti (scetti.org) stands for State Clean Electricity Transition Tracker India, an Open Data initiative aimed at identifying policy opportunities for Indian statesâ€™ transition to clean electricity towards Net Zero. This repository was created for developing self-service web apps to analyze climate policies and corporate sustainability reports at scale. The apps are available at scetti.org/policy_tools.
