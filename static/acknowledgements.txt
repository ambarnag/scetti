The prior classifier identifies sentences which pertain to environment or climate change. This step filters out text which is unrelated to climate change and therefore unlikely to contain targets of the kind we are looking for. We are using the **ESGBERT-environmental** model developed by Tobias Schimanski, Andrin Reding, Nico Reding, Julia Bingler, Mathias Kraus, and Markus Leippold. The opensource model, along with more information about the project, is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ESGBERT/EnvironmentalBERT-environmental).

The Netzero classifier identifies sentences which contain  [netzero](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition), GHG reduction, or other targets. Note that netzero targets are a special case of reduction targets where a Country, State, or Region seeks to reduce emissions down to zero. We are using the **national-climate-targets** model developed by [Climate Policy Radar](https://climatepolicyradar.org). The Climate Policy Radar team is comprised by Matyas Juhasz, Tina Marchand, Roshan Melwani, Kalyan Dutia, Sarah Goodenough, Harrison Pim, and Henry Franks. The opensource model is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ClimatePolicyRadar/national-climate-targets).
